What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 - it creates overall structure for all the possible things you might need (folders and metadata files) for version control (branches, HEAD, etc.)
 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 - it is sort of package compilation area, where you would you would control, validate any files that will go from working to repository.
